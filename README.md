# Horse-or-human-classification
A machine learning project to take input of an image and classify it to horse or human

Problem Statement :
To classify images as horse or human using image processing in Machine
Learning.

Introduction:
This project is using the tensorflow, keras, numpy and matplotlib libraries.
The model is trained using horse or human dataset.
The model is a sequential convolutional neural network model, with one
input and one output layer along with five hidden layers.
CNN is a supervised machine learning algorithm.
It is used for image classification and computer vision.
The model will take input of a 300x300 image and classify it accordingly
into horse or human.
The training accuracy of this model is 0.9883.
Validation accuracy of it is 0.8711.
The output prints the images uploaded along with their respective predicted
classes.
